# qplot
QPlot is an alternative 2D plotting library for Python, Matlab, and Octave that facilitates beautiful typography and precise axis scaling.

Binaries are available for Ubuntu Linux and for Windows. (On Windows, only Python is currently supported.) 
Compiling from source on other Linux versions or on Mac OS should be straightforward.
