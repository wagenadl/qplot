     ABSDATA and RELDATA are specified in data coordinates.
     ABSPAPER and RELPAPER are specified in paper coordinates
     ROTDATA uses atan2(eta, xi) for its angle. ROTPAPER is directly specified
     in radians.
     Retraction is along the line segment; two numbers may be given for 
     internal points. Distances are specified in postscript points.
   
     For instance,
       gline ( absdata 0 1 relpaper 5 0 ) ( absdata 0 1 relpaper 0 5 )
     draws a line from 5 pt to the right of the point (0,1) in the graph to
     5 pt above the point (1,0) on the graph.
