- Test gline:
  GLINE: command for supergeneral line drawing:
     gline ( pt1spec ) ( pt2spec ) ...
  
  where ptnspec is:
     command1 args1 ...
  
  where commands are:
     absdata x y
     abspaper x y
     reldata dx dy
     relpaper dx dy
     rotdata xi eta
     rotpaper phi
     retract l [l2]
  
  Retraction is along the line segment; two numbers may be given for internal
  points.
  
- Group/EndGroup should save more state, including pen, brush,
  alignment and font. Even anchor? Or should grouping and save/restore be
  separate concepts? Right now, grouping is just about bboxes, but that is
  not obvious to the user. I find it confusing that complex matlab commands
  like qxaxis mess with alignment.

- Interaction between panels and groups should be spelled out. Right now,
  it is not good to switch panels while inside a group. ChoosePanel reports
  this, and simply clears the stack.

- Make the "matlab" functions work with octave.

- Create an attractive collection of examples.
