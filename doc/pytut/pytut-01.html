      QPlot Tutorial — Your first graph

<h1>Creating your first graph</h1>

<p>Creating a basic graph in QPlot is just as easy as with Matplotlib. For instance:</p>

<div class="example">
<p class="eg">  import numpy as np</p>
<p class="eg">  import pyqplot as qp</p>
<p class="eg">  x = np.arange(-10, 10, 0.1)</p>
<p class="eg">  <a href="../pyref/plot.html">qp.plot</a>(x, np.sin(x))  </p>
</div>

<p>(Type this at the python or ipython command prompt.) A window similar to the one below should appear:</p>

<div><img src="pytut-01-01.png"></div>

<p>(If that does not happen, something is broken. Did you install numpy? Can python find the pyqplot library? Did you add the qplot binary to your system search path?)</p>

<p>Installation problems out of the way? Let’s save our graph:</p>

<div class="example">
<p class="eg">  <a href="../ref/qp.save.html">qp.save</a>('MyFirstGraph.pdf')</p>
</div>

<p>This produces a pdf file; you could also have saved your graph as a bitmap (jpeg, png, etc.) or as vector graphics (svg) just as easily.</p>

<p>This example has hopefully demonstrated that using QPlot is easy enough. But it probably hasn’t yet convinced you that you <i>want</i> to use QPlot. Please hang on, there is <a href="pytut-02.html">more to come</a>.
