      QPlot Tutorial — Your first graph

<h1>Creating your first graph</h1>

<p>Creating a basic graph in QPlot is just as easy as in Matlab or Octave. In fact, the first example from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Two_002dDimensional-Plots.html">Octave&rsquo;s plotting tutorial<a> can be used almost directly:</p>

<div class="example">
<p class="eg">  x = -10:0.1:10;    </p>
<p class="eg">  <a href="../ref/qplot.html">qplot</a>(x, sin(x));  </p>
</div>

<p>(Type this at the Octave or Matlab command prompt.) A window similar to the one below should appear:</p>

<div><img src="tut-01-01.png"></div>

<p>(If that does not happen, something is broken. Assuming that you <i>can</i> create native Matlab or Octave figures (try typing <span class="inlineeg">plot(x, sin(x));</span>), the problem lies with your QPlot installation. Did you add QPlot to your search path?)</p>
<p>Installation problems out of the way? Let’s save our graph:</p>

<div class="example">
<p class="eg">  <a href="../ref/qsave.html">qsave</a> MyFirstGraph.pdf  </p>
</div>

<p>This produces a pdf file; you could also have saved your graph as a bitmap (jpeg, png, etc.) or as vector graphics (svg) just as easily.</p>

<p>This example has hopefully demonstrated that using QPlot is easy enough. But it probably hasn’t yet convinced you that you <i>want</i> to use QPlot. Please hang on, there is <a href="tut-02.html">more to come</a>.
