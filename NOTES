The current pen/brush/subplot should be actively removed from the map.
I don't remember why this needs to happen. Presumably, the affected
functions are Figure::choosenPen/Brush/Panel.

BBoxes should be handled properly at subplot change.  I don't remember
what the problem is, or whether I fixed it yet. I suspect I probably
did.

More examples are in order.

The Matlab code should be checked for Octave compatibility.

The specification of label positions in qcolorbar.m is less than
ideal. Or at least, I find it confusing.

The thing needs to be published somehow!
