The current pen/brush/subplot should be actively removed from the map.
I don't remember why this needs to happen. Presumably, the affected
functions are Figure::choosenPen/Brush/Panel.

BBoxes should be handled properly at subplot change.  I don't remember
what the problem is, or whether I fixed it yet. I suspect I probably
did.

More examples are in order.

The Matlab code should be checked for Octave compatibility.

The specification of label positions in qcolorbar.m is less than
ideal. Or at least, I find it confusing.

The thing needs to be published somehow!

The new QCBAR and QCAXIS need to be documented along with the new axis
modifiers.

A new (C level) command "gimage" should allow drawing images in more
general coordinates: mixing data and paper coordinates is useful for
colorbars.

A new (C level) command "sharelim" should link either or both the x and y
ranges of selected subplots:

  sharelim [x|y] ID1 ID2 ...

The matlab functions QPLOT and friends should automatically split up
the data into multiple chunks at NaNs. Or perhaps this is best
implemented at C level.
