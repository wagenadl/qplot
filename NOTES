The current pen/brush/subplot should be actively removed from the map.
I don't remember why this needs to happen. Presumably, the affected
functions are Figure::choosenPen/Brush/Panel.

BBoxes should be handled properly at subplot change.  I don't remember
what the problem is, or whether I fixed it yet. I suspect I probably
did.

More examples are in order.

The Matlab code should be checked for Octave compatibility.

The specification of label positions in qcolorbar.m is less than
ideal. Or at least, I find it confusing.

The thing needs to be published somehow!

qcolorbar should *only* have xywh arg, and perhaps h/v arg. It should
assume the LUT and CLIM from the most recent QIMSC.  A new qcaxis
command should add labels to the qcolorbar. The CLIM still applies, so
locations are specified in terms of that range. qcaxis takes a first
argument, normally zero, that specifies the distance from the
qcolorbar. That makes directly analogous to the QXAXIS and QYAXIS.

A new (C level) command "share" should link either or both the x and y
ranges of selected subplots:

  share [x|y] ID1 ID2 ...
