120126. Error reporting should be better: For interactive use, they
should be collected and reported upon click on a simple message
displayed at the bottom of the graph. No more automatic popups. If a
C++-level error results from MLOCT use, a request for a bug report
should be issued. For noninteractive use, return code from the
executable should be set.

120126. Shrink/ShareLim should set a flag in the figure to indicate
whether or not a substantive change was made. Then, instead of blindly
doing two prerendering steps, iteration could be intelligently
controlled. And "shrink failed" would be issued after (5) iterations
rather than based on an arbitrary "too much shrinkage" criterion.

120126. When converting to new Axes implementation, I need to eradicate all
instances of the assumption that x-axes run left to right and y-axes upward.

11xxxx. The current pen/brush/subplot should be actively removed from the map.
1201xx. I don't remember why this needs to happen. Presumably, the affected
functions are Figure::choosenPen/Brush/Panel.

11xxxx. BBoxes should be handled properly at subplot change.
1201xx. I don't remember what the problem is, or whether I fixed it
yet. I suspect I probably did.

1201xx. More examples are in order.

1201xx. The Matlab code should be checked for Octave compatibility.
120126. I made some progress on this.

1201xx. The thing needs to be published somehow!

1201xx. The new QCBAR and QCAXIS need to be documented along with the new axis
modifiers.

A new (C level) command "sharelim" should link either or both the x and y
ranges of selected subplots:

  sharelim [x|y] ID1 ID2 ...

q3plot q3view q3xaxis q3yaxis q3zaxis ?

Functions for making legends?
